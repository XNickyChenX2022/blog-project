# I. Introduction
Welcome to my Blog Web Application.
To see a demo, watch this youtube video displaying the project(https://youtu.be/Zb_7Ufm5yqs)
This project uses Flask, Javascript(jQuery, Fetch API), PostgreSQL.
This project includes the following features:
  * Uses Flask-Login for login and registration purposes
  * Uses Flask-SQLAlchemy to create models for PostgreSQL database.
  * Enables users the ability to make posts, search for posts, look for posts they have made, like and dislike posts/comments, edit/delete/make/reply to comments
  * Uses Fetch-API to dynamically insert/update/ delete comments, likes, dislikes, and posts
# II. Using the Application
1.clone the repo (open in vscode)
```

```
4.Create Postgresql database (install postgresql and use pgAdmin4)
	create a server in pgadmin. Then in pgadmin create database (mine was called blog_database, remember this for later). Use the following below for initializing the server.
   * Hostname/address: localhost
   * Port:5432
   * Username:Postgres

5. In Configuration.py (in the app folder, under templates folder) change the SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI to connect to your database locally.
   See Example Below
   ```
   class Config:
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://postgres:password@localhost/blog_database'
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
   ```
   Fill in the placeholders shown in Config.py
6. go to the terminal and type the following commands to install the database.
